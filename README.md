# DnD React
 2.0 of my DnD React app. 
 I'm a novice programmer and this project is a learn-as-you-go effort, so please concider it alpha-as-f$%k.

The intent of this project is to create a usable app for non-commercial use. If you are interested in contributing to this effort on that basis, I'll be happy to concider pull requests to help improve features or fix bugs..

## App layout
The app will make use of several pages, using React Router functionality. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-router-include-router-hooks/

State will be passed through the app via the react-router-dom Link component. Then accessed using useLocation(). https://dev.to/maxcell/react-router-using-location-state-for-custom-ui-navigation-2ia9?utm_source=pocket_mylist

 ## Roadmap
View what I'm planning and currently working on [here](https://trello.com/b/Gks4VriW/development).
 
## Data
The state for this app is stored in json https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp

The state will be served by json-server using Javascript fetch requests. https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

cUrl for testing e.g.;
* curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"campaign":"1","name":"curl","description":"put this on the server with Curl"}' http://localhost:8001/adventures
*  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8001/adventures/${id}
*  curl -X GET -i http://localhost:8001/adventures/${id}
*  curl -X  GET -i http://192.168.1.200:8001/adventures/2?_embed=npcs

The structure for the data is as follows (this will be updated as features are added and the data structure grows & changes);
